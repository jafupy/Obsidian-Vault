# The Vault

The vault is a prison inside Wrath. The Vault has 3 layers, varying in security. 

### Layer 1

The first layer is of the lowest security, and the prisoners enjoy a high standard of living. While the guards are on duty, the cells are unlocked and the inmates are free to roam around and use whatever amenities they wish.

### Layer 2

This layer is tighter on security, but the inmates still get to roam during certain hours. 

### Layer 3

The inmates all have personal guards assigned, and are locked 24/7 with sealing enchantments making it impossible to escape.

The Vault is built on top of a plane of runes and symbols forming many protective and sealing enchantments, fuelled by massive catalysts. These are magical gems that are imbued with runes, strengthening the enchantments. The sealing enchantments are so strong however, that some say the lands adapted to them.
