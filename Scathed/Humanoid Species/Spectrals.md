Spectrals are mystical beings often regarded as vile creatures. Although they are not considered truly alive, they persist in an undead state, tethered to life. Spectrals have long lifespans, averaging 500 years. In Norria, the general population holds a deep disdain for Spectrals, driving them to the northern regions.

## Stasis

To extend their existence, a Spectral can enter stasis by binding its life force to an object through powerful spells. While in stasis, a Spectral becomes immortal, impervious to any form of death. However, destruction of the stasis-bound object results in the Spectral's immediate death. Due to the complex and excruciating nature of this process, most Spectrals avoid it. Only scholars and scientists typically undergo stasis, seeking to prolong their work and complete their life's endeavours.

## Necromancy

Spectrals possess the ability to resurrect deceased Humans and Dwarves due to their undead nature. However, most can only restore the dead to a state of half-life, where the revived are bound to serve their masters in a perpetual state of agony and despair. A rare few can fully resurrect the dead, but even fewer choose to do so, preferring instead to enslave those who once banished them.

## Rose Spectrals

Rose Spectrals are considered inferior to regular Spectrals. They are born when a Spectral mother dies during childbirth. Seen as cursed or flawed, Rose Spectrals are often abandoned or killed shortly after birth.

## Additional Notes

- Spectrals primarily inhabit [Wrath](Wrath.md).
- They are responsible for guarding [The Vault](The%20Vault.md).
