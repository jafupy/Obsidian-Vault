# Humans
#Scathed 

Humans are the most basic and magicless of the sentient races, lacking the innate ability to wield [The Thread](Thread.md), unlike [Elves](Elves.md), [Dwarves](Dwarves.md), and [Spectrals](Spectrals.md). 

Human societies are known for their diversity and complexity, ranging from small tribal communities to large, bustling cities.
