"The Alive" is a term coined by the [Spectrals](Spectrals.md) to describe any being that is not undead. This term primarily refers to [Dwarves](Dwarves.md), [Elves](Elves.md), and [Humans](Humans.md). 

The term is seen as inoffensive, as The Undead is a term used for Spectrals and Beings resurrected partially by [Necromancy](Spectrals.md#Necromancy)
