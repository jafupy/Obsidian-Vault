# The Thread

#Scathed 

The Thread is the magic system, rooted in runes, enchantments, and body movement. It can be utilised by [Elves](Elves.md), [Dwarves](Dwarves.md), and [Spectrals](Spectrals.md). The Thread is believed to originate from The Creator.

## Origin and History

The Thread was discovered thousands of years ago by the same Spectral who first entered stasis. This individual, later known as the First Weaver, unlocked the secrets of The Thread and laid the foundation for its use among the magical races. Over time, The Thread became an integral part of their cultures, shaping their societies and destinies.

## Learning and Mastery

All magical beings are born with the innate ability to weave The Thread. 

## Forms of Magic

The Thread is non-verbal and does not require wands or external tools like in other magic systems. Magic is channelled through limbs and runes, which can be used to create everlasting enchantments. These runes serve as a key to unlocking various magical abilities, from simple spells to complex weaves.

## Cultural Significance

**Spectrals**: Basic magic is common among them, but more advanced forms are highly revered, seen as a mark of great power and knowledge.
**Dwarves & Elves**: They revere magic, with few being able to weave.

## Limitations and Costs

- **Spectrals**: The use of The Thread has no significant drawbacks.
- **Elves and Dwarves**: Using The Thread can cause temporary ageing, which fades after a few days. The extent of this effect depends on the complexity of the spell or weave being cast.

## Key Figures

The most notable figure in the history of The Thread is the First Weaver, the Spectral who first discovered this magic. Their teachings and legacy continue to influence the use of The Thread among all the magical races.
