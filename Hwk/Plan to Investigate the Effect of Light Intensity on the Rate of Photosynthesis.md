## Aim
Observe and understand the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis in plants.

## Equipment
1. Beakers
2. Measuring Tape
3. Lamp
4. Aquatic Plant (Elodea)
5. Stopwatch
6. Thermometer

## Method
1. Set up the aquatic plant in a beaker filled with water.
2. Place the lamp at a set distance from the plant.
3. Turn the lamp on to initiate the photosynthesis process.
4. Record the number of bubbles produced in one minute.
5. Repeat this process at different distances (light intensity levels), ensuring temperature stays constant.
6. Record all measurements.

## Variables
**Independent Variable:** Light intensity (distance of lamp from plant) 

**Dependent Variable:** Rate of photosynthesis (number of bubbles produced) 

**Control Variables:** 
- Type/Species of plant
- Temperature
- Volume of water
- CO2 availability 

## Risk Assessment
1. Supervise the use of electrical appliances near water.
2. Handle the plant gently.
3. Don't touch the light bulb of the lamp.

## Results Table
| Distance (cm) | No. of Bubbles in 1 minute |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| 10            |                            |
| 20            |                            |
| 30            |                            |

## How to Make Results Accurate
Ensure the same plant is used throughout, maintain same conditions (CO2, temperature), use a precise stopwatch for timing. 

## How to Ensure Control Variables Stay the Same
Monitor temperature constantly, ensure the same lamp and plant type are used.
